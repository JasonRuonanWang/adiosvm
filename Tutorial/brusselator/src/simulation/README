The Brusselator source code has been forked from https://github.com/openmichigan/PSNM.
Its dependency - 2decomp_fft, has been downloaded from http://www.2decomp.org. Current version of 2decomp_fft is 1.5.847.

Run

Compiling the code creates an executable called 'Brusselator'.
You can run this with mpirun (or other methods such as aprun on Cray machines):

Example:
`mpirun -np 4 ./Brusselator`

All output data is written to `./data/brusselator.bp`.
